# Appendix C. Text version of CERN mechanism with supporting evidence

## Inputs
- Funding and staff for research facility construction and operation [1,5]
- Funding and staff for organisation activities and governance [1,5]
- Experiment proposals [27]
- Robust scientific evidence nuclear weapons pose an existential or catastrophic risk [4]

## Activities
- Fundamental nuclear research [1]
- Construction and maintenance of particle accelerators [1]
- Stimulating international co-operation [1,7,8]
- Train physicists, engineers, and technicians [3,9]
- Open dissemination of research results [4]
- Advocate investment in fundamental research and evidence-based policy [9]
- Knowledge transfer to industry [9]
- Outreach [9,24]
- Maintain world-leading status [9,10]
- Council meetings to appoint Director-General and determine CERN's scientific, technical, and administrative policies [11]
- Scientific Policy Committee meet and make recommendations to the Council on research priorities and advise on management and staffing of the organisation [12]
- CERN Research Board reviews experiment proposal applications [13]
- Perform safety studies to address fears of catastrophic risks [14, 23]
- Finance Committee meets and advises Council on financial management [15]
- Council determines member state contributions based on Net National Income [18]
- Conform with Host State regulations on radiation safety and IAEA inspection of strategic materials [19]

## Outputs
- Open publications of fundamental nuclear research results [25]
- Particle accelerator facilities [26]
- Formal international collaborations [5]
- Physics, Engineering, and Technician talent [16]
- Outreach material [24]
- Safety studies to address fears of catastrophic risks [22,23]
- New technology [20, 21]

## Intermediate Outcomes 1
- Increased investment in fundamental research
- Increased investment in evidence-based policy
- Knowledge transferred to industry [20, 21]
- Soft power in international relations through Council's ability to add or suspend members [6]
- Proliferation of progressive academic norms [16]
- Ability of nations with great human talent, but few material resources to contribute to fundamental research [16]

## Intermediate Outcomes 2
- Push the frontiers of technology [3]
- Positive impact on society globally [21]
- Unite global scientific communities around a common goal [3]
- Global research, engineering and technician talent developed [3]

## Final Outcomes
- The frontiers of scientific knowledge of the fundamental structure of the universe extended [1,2,9]
- World-class physics research facility maintained [4,9]
- Peace promoted through international collaboration [4-6,18]
